## Exercise 10.1
> The algorithm header defines a function named count that , like find, takes a pair of iterators and a value. count returns a count of how often that value appears. Read a sequence of ints into a vector and print hte count of how many elements have a given value.
```c++ 
count(ivec.cbegin(), ivec.cend(), 42);  
```

## Exercise 10.2
> Repeat the previous program, but read values into a list of strings.

## Exercise 10.3
> Use accumulate to sum the elements in a vector<int>.

## Exercise 10.4
> Assuming v is a vector<double>, what, if anything, is wrong with calling accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), 0)?

## Exercise 10.5
> In the call to equal on rosters, what would happen if both rosters held C-style strings, rather that library strings?

## Exercise 10.6
> Using fill_n, write a program to set a sequence of int values to 0.

## Exercise 10.7
> Determine if there are any errors in the following programs and , if so, correct the error(s).
a) 
vector<int> vec; list<int> lst; int i;
while(cin>>i)
  lst.push_back(i);
copy(lst.cbegin(), lst.cend(), vec.begin()); // back_inserter(vec)

b)
vector<int> vec;
vec.reverse(10); 
fill_n(vec.begin(), 10, 0); // back_inserter(vec)

## Exercise 10.8
> We said that algorithms do not change the size of the containers over which they operate. Why doesn't the use of back_inserter invalidate this claim?
cc: 算法仍然没有, 是迭代器自己插入的


## Exercise 10.9
> Implement your own version of elimDups. Test your program by printing the vector after you read the input, after the call to unique, and after the call to erase.

## Exercise 10.10
> Why do  you think the algorithms don't change the size of containers?
cc: 元素类型独立
基于迭代器而不是容器

## Exercise 10.11
> Write a program that uses stable_sort and isShorter to sort a vector passed to your version of elimDups. Print the vector to verify that your program is correct.

## Exercise 10.12
> Write a function named compareIsbn that compares the isbn() members of two Sales_data objects. Use that function to sort a vector that holds Sales_data objects.

## Exercise 10.13
> The library defines an algorithm named partition that takes a predicate and partitions the container so that values for which the predicate is true appear in the first part and those for which the predicate is false appear in the second part. The algorithm returns an iterator just past the last element for which the predicate returned true. Write a function that takes a string and returns a bool indicating whether the string has five characters or more. Use the function to partition words. Print the elements that have five or more characters.

## Exercise 10.14
> Write a lambda that takes two ints and returns their sum.

## Exercise 10.15
> Write a lambda that captures an int from its enclosing function and takes an int parameter. The lambda should return the sum of the captured int and the int parameter.

## Exercise 10.16
> Write your own version of the biggies function using lambdas.

## Exercise 10.17
> Rewrite exercise 10.12 from 10.3.1 to use a lambda in the call to sort instead of the compareIsbn function.

## Exercise 10.18
> Rewrite biggies to use partition instead of find_if. We described the partition algorithm in exercise10.13 in 10.3.1.

## Exercise 10.19
> Rewrite the previous exercise to use stable_partition, which like stable_sort maintains the original element order in the partitioned sequence.

## Exercise 10.20
> The library defines an algorithm named count_if. Like find_if, this function takes a pair of iterators denoting an input range and a predicate that it applies to each element in the given range . count_if returns a count of how often the predicate is true. Use count_if to rewrite the portion of our program that counted how many words are greater than length 6.

## Exercise 10.21
> Write a lambda that capture a local int variable and decrements that variable until it reaches 0. Once the variable is 0 additional calls should no longer decrement the variable. The lambda should return a bool that indicates whether the captured variable is 0.

## Exercise 10.22
> Rewrite the program to count words of size 6 or less using functions in the place of the lambdas.

## Exercise 10.23
> How many arguments does bind take?

## Exercise 10.24
> Use bind and check_size to find the first element in a vector of ints that has a value greater than the length of a specified string value.

## Exercise 10.25
> In the exercises for 10.3.2 you wrote a version of biggies that uses partition . Rewrite that function to use check_size and bind.

## Exercise 10.26
> Explain the differences among the three kinds of insert iterators.
cc:
back_inserter 调用push_back
front_inserter 调用push_front
inserter 调用insert, 返回的迭代器指向的位置不变
都是在指定迭代器之前插入元素

## Exercise 10.27
> In addition to 10.2.3 , the library defines function named unique_copy that takes a third iterator denoting a destination into which to copy the unique elements. Write a program that uses unique_copy to copy the unique elements from a vector into an initially empty list.


## Exercise 10.28
> Copy a vector that holds the values from 1 to 9 inclusive, into three other containers. Use an inserter, a back_inserter, and a front_inserter, respectively to add elements to there containers. Predict how the output sequence varies by the kind of inserter and verify your predications by running your programs.

## Exercise 10.29
> Write a program using stream iterators to read a text file into a vector of strings.

## Exercise 10.30
> Use stream iterators, sort, and copy to read a sequence of integers from the standard input, sort them , and then write them back to the standard output.

## Exercise 10.31
> Update the program from the previous exercise so that it prints only the unique elements. Your program should use unique_copy(10.4.1)

## Exercise 10.32
> Rewrite the bookstore program from 1.6 using a vector to hold the transactions and various algorithms to do the processing. Use sort with your compareIsbn function from 10.3.1 to arrange the transactions in order, and then use find and accumulate to do the sum.

## Exercise 10.33
> Write a program that takes the names of an input file and two output files. The input file should hold integers. Using an istream_iterator read the input file. Using ostream_iterators, write the odd numbers into the first output file. Each value should be followed by a space. Write hte even numbers into the second file. Each of these values should be placed on a separate line.

## Exercise 10.34
> Use reverse_iterators to print a vector in reverse order.

## Exercise 10.35
> Now print the elements in reverse order using ordinary iterators.

## Exercise 10.36
> Use find to find the last element in a list of ints with value 0;

## Exercise 10.37
> Given a vector that has ten elements, copy the elements from positions 3 through 7 in reverse order to a list.

## Exercise 10.38
> List the five iterator categories and the operations that each supports.
cc:
input: 
- ++
- ==, !=
- *
- ->

output:
- ++
- *
输出不包含访问, 输入才需要访问
什么时候需要比较两个迭代器是否相等?
我知道了, 判断是否为eof

forward iterator: 
重复, 保存状态

bidirectional iterator: 
--
random access iterator: 
- +=,-=, +,-
- >,<,>=,<=
- []
- - 迭代器距离

## Exercise 10.39
> What kind of iterator does a list have? What about a vector?
list: bidirectional iterator
vector: random access iterator

## Exercise 10.40
> What kinds of iterators do you think copy requires? What about reverse or unique?
input, output
reverse: bidirectional iterator
unique: forward


## Exercise 10.41
> Based only on the algorithm and argument names, describe the operation that the each of the following library algorithms performs:
replace(beg, end, old_val, new_val); // 替换
replace_if(beg, end, pred, new_val); // pred替换
replace_copy(beg,end, dest, old_val, new_val); // 替换并复制
replace_copy_if(beg, end, dest, pred, new_val); // pred替换并复制

## Exercise 10.42
> Reimplement the program that eliminated duplicate words that we wrote in 10.2.3 to use a list instead of a vector.
