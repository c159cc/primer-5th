## Exercise 17.4
> Write and test your own version of the findBook function.

## Exercise 17.5
> Rewrite findBook to return a pair that holds an index and a pair of iterators.

## Exercise 17.6
> Rewrite findBook so that it does not use tuple or pair.

## Exercise 17.7
> Explain which version of findBook you prefer and why.

## Exercise 17.8
> What would happen if we passed Sales_data() as the third parameter to accumulate in the last code example in this section?

## Exercise 17.9
> Explain the bit pattern each of the following bitset objects contains:
(a) bitset<64> bitvec(32);
(b) bitset<32> bv(1010101);
(c) string bstr; cin>>bstr; bitset<8> bv(bstr);

## Exercise 17.10
> Using the sequence 1,2,3,5,8,13,21, initialize a bitset that has a 1 bit in each position corresponding to a number in this sequence . Default initialize another bitset and write a small program to turn on each of the appropriate bits.

## Exercise 17.11
> Define a data structure that contains an integral object to track responses to a true/false quiz containing 10 questions. what changes, if any, would you need to make in your data structure if the quiz had 100 questions?

## Exercise 17.12
> Using the data structure from the previous question, write a function that takes a question number and a value to indicate a true/false answer and updates the quiz results accordingly.

## Exercise 17.13
> Write an integral object that contains the correct answers for the true/false quiz. Use it to generate grades on the quiz for the data structure from the precious two exercises.

## Exercise 17.14
> Write several regular expressions designed to trigger various errors. Run your program to see what output your compiler generates for each error.

## Exercise 17.15
> Write a program using the pattern that finds words that violate the "i before e except after c" rule. Have your program prompt the user to supply a word and indicate whether the word is okay or not. Test your program with words that do and do not violate the rule.

## Exercise 17.16
> What would happen if your regex object in the precious program were initialized with "[^c]ei"? Test your program using that pattern to see whether your expectations were correct.

## Exercise 17.17
> Update your program so that it finds all the words in an input sequence that violate the "ei" grammar rule.

## Exercise 17.18
> Revise your program to ignore words that contain "ei" but are not misspellings, such as "albeit" and "neighbor.";

## Exercise 17.19
> Why is it okay to call m[4].str() without first checking whether m[4] was matched?
如果m[4]没匹配, 短路或短路了

## Exercise 17.20
> Write your own version of the program to validate phone numbers.

## Exercise 17.21
> Rewrite your phone number program from 7.3.2 to use the valid function defined in this section.
 
## Exercise 17.22
> Rewrite your phone number program so that it allows any number of whitespace characters to separate the three parts of a phone number.

## Exercise 17.23
> Write a regular expression to find zip codes. A zip code can have five or nine digits. The first five digits can be separated from the remaining four by a dash.

## Exercise 17.24
> Write your own version of the program to reformat phone numbers.

## Exercise 17.25
> Write your phone program so that it writes only the first phone number for each person.

## Exercise 17.26
> Rewrite your phone program so that it writes only the second and subsequent phone numbers for people with more than one phone number.

## Exercise 17.27
> Write a program that  reformats a nine-digit zip code as ddddd-dddd.

## Exercise 17.28
> Write a function that generates and returns a uniformly distributed random unsigned int each time it is called.

## Exercise 17.29
> Allow the user to supply a seed as an optional argument to the function you wrote in the precious exercise.

## Exercise 17.30
> Revise your function again this time to take a minimum and maximum value for the numbers that the function should return.

## Exercise 17.31
> What would happen if we defined b and e inside the do loop of the game-playing program from this section?

## Exercise 17.32
> What would happen if we defined resp inside the loop?

## Exercise 17.33
> Write a version of the word transformation program from 11.3.6 that allows multiple transformations for a given word and randomly selects which transformation to apply.

## Exercise 17.34
> Write a program that illustrates the use of each manipulator in tables 17.17 and 17.18

## Exercise 17.35
> Write a version of the program from page 758, that printed the square root of 2 but this time print hexadecimal digits in uppercase.

## Exercise 17.36
> Modify the program from the previous exercise to print the various floating-point values so that they line up in a column.

## Exercise 17.37
> Use the unformatted version of getline to read a file a line at a time. Test your program by giving it a file that contains empty lines as well as lines that are longer than the character array that you pass to getline.

## Exercise 17.38
> Extend your program from the precious exercise to print each word you read onto its own line.
